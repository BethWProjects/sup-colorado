    "overview": "This Summit County hotspot is home to several annual regattas, which are a delight to watch. If you love to be in the center of the action, this is your spot. Dillon Reservoir is surrounded by several nearby campgrounds, so if youâ€™re into camping, this is a great spot to visit. The reservoir is strict about safety - one Coast Guard approved PFD for each person must be on board your SUP at all times - so be prepared and stay safe!",
